# Title: Weekly Meal Planner

***Description: In this project, I will create a simple weekly meal planner using C++. The program will allow users to input their meal preferences for each day of the week and generate a meal plan accordingly. Users can input breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack options for each day, categorizing them by food type or cuisine. The program will use basic data types to store meal options, file input/output for saving and loading meal plans, and conditional statements to suggest meal options based on user preferences and dietary restrictions.***
